OK, so you have downloaded the copy of LIRA from github.
Let us say it is at /soft/LIRA.git/lira

I strongly recommend to _not_ touch that directory unless you have explicit changes to make and want to send it back upstream.
Instead, copy lira to a new directory --
	mkdir -p /soft/LIRA.install
	cp -rp /soft/LIRA.git/lira /soft/LIRA.install/.

Now build the LIRA package and install it in your R library.
(These instructions should work for R versions 3+ and on Mac OS X.7+ and on latest CentOS)
	cd /soft/LIRA.install
	mv lira/inst .
		#because lira/inst/ only contains documentation and examples which are unnecessary to run the package
	R CMD BUILD lira
		#this will produce a tar file, which is used in the next step
		#on CentOS systems you may need to use lower-case for "build"
	R CMD INSTALL lira_0.1.tar.gz Rlira
		#I (VK) don't know if it is necessary to call it Rlira.  I did,
		#and it worked, and I have no wish to experiment with a working installation!

That's it.
(Note that it will be installed in your ~/Library/, so won't be available globally.)
You can now start up R and do
	require(lira)
and lira() will be available.

You will also need to have the FITSio package installed.
You can do this via the R GUI package manager.
