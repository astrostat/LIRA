Setting up the LIRA repository
[vlk 2012aug07, with major help from Tom A]

/* NEED TO DO STEPS 0-3 THE FIRST TIME SETTING UP THE GITHUB REPOSITORY */
/* STEP 4 LISTS SOME COMMON TASKS YOU CAN DO REPEATEDLY AFTER SETTING IT UP */

Step 0: get a github account

http://github.com

	accounts are free

Step 1: setting up the ssh keys
(see https://help.github.com/articles/generating-ssh-keys )

cd ~/.ssh
ssh-keygen -t rsa -C "your_email@must_match_the_one_you_gave_to_github"

	give it an easily remembered passphrase

pbcopy < ./id_rsa.pub
	(this only works on Macs)

	This makes a copy into a buffer which you just paste (Command-V on MAC) 
	into the Key window on the web page in Step 2.
	(only on Mac OS X)

Step 2: add the ssh key to github

https://github.com/settings/ssh

	Add Key by pasting into the appropriate field.
	Set Title as something that tells you what email you used.

Step 3: set up the local repository

cd /path/to/where/you/want/the/LIRA/repository/
git clone git@github.com:vkashyap/LIRA.git

	this will download everything there is on the github repository
	and will put everything into the subdirectory
	/path/to/where/you/want/the/LIRA/repository/LIRA/


/* At this point you have successfully downloaded the LIRA repository to your local machine */
/* The following are steps you might use repeatedly as you edit and update LIRA */

Step 4: using the repository

	You must always cd to the location of the repository for these commands to work

git pull
	will download the latest changes

	make edits, changes, etc. to files

git add files
git commit -m "some descriptive text saying what was changed"
git push
