This directory contains IDL routines to read in the outputs of LIRA and cast them into FITS files useful for postprocessing.

rd_liraout.pro	-- which reads the LIRA outputs into an IDL structure
liraimages.pro	-- which makes nice summary plots and writes out FITS files

idl_lira.sav	-- The above routines need some programs from PINTofALE,
		   IDL-Astro, and the Coyote library.  A compiled version
		   of all the required routines are in this file.  Restore
		   in IDL prior to running rd_liraout or liraimages.

liraimages_template.par
		-- this is a script designed to call rd_liraout and
		   liraimages.  Modify to suit your needs.
